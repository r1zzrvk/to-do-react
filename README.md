### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `about project`

The app is written on react hooks.\
Here I showed how `hooks` work and how to pass data through `props`\
I used standart hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`\
I implemented simple filtering to check 'completed' or not

The data is stored in `local storage`.\
I created two functions to manage local storage `saveLocalTodos` and `getLocalTodos`

Simple, adaptive UI made with `bootstrap`.

Deploy on `gh-pages`
